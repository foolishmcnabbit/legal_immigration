# legal_immigration
A python data project analyzing legal immigration patterns into the USA

In this project I downloaded legal immigration data and U.S. population data in order to analyze legal immigration rates into the U.S.A. I created visualizations showing the number of legal immigrants arriving each year dating back to 1820. I also visualized more recent immigration data from 2000 to present. 

I identified the 20 years in our history with the highest number of legal immigrants. Also, I merged a population dataset into the immigration dataset, calculated immigrants per capita and plotted the results. Additionally, I visualized a scatter plot of immigrants vs. general population numbers. 

Lastly, I utilized an AR(1) regression model on annual immigration numbers in order to predict the next 5 years of immigrant numbers.
